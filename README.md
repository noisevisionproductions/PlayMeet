One boring day, I had the urge to play Tennis, but nobody from my friends list was available that day. Back then I was struggling to find portfolio ideas for potentially my first job as a software developer in Java. Then, it appeared in my head to create an Android app called:
# PlayMeet
The goal was to help users search for people for sports games in real life, whether it is a user's first-time, amateur, or advanced level.
For now, it allows users to create an account, and create a post that contains information about the game, like location, date, and number of people needed. Then, other users can use filters that I created, to find more specific requirements he's looking for, and sign in to the post that he find interesting. Users can also send a message to each other in real-time, thanks to Firebase Realtime Database, which allows for real-time data syncing.
Since this is my first big project I decided to create it sometime around October, it took me some time to develop. It was a bumpy road because I had no experience in Android and front-end development, but in the end, I learned a lot.

## Installation
It took me about a month to understand the Google Play console and learn about the process of app publishing, but finally, my app is available at Google Play:
